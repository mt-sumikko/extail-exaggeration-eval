# extail-exaggeration-eval
 Collection of sources for evaluating the exaggeration of hair bundle behavior by Extail

## A: Move the head from side to side.
The device was attached to the print head of a 3D printer and moved horizontally.
We used ANYCUBIC i3 Mega S, and controlled with [horizontal_movement.gcode](https://github.com/mt-sumikko/extail-exaggeration-eval/blob/master/horizontal_movement.gcode)

### A-1

## B: Tilt the head from side to side.
A rod with a device attached was attached to a servo motor to make it rotate.
We used servo motor DS3218, and controlled with [rotate_movement.ino
](https://github.com/mt-sumikko/extail-exaggeration-eval/blob/master/rotate_movement/rotate_movement.ino)

## Note
In each of A and B, the -2 video is exaggerated by the actuation.

## Reference: Wearing demo
The following videos show the same device equipped with the same program as in the above experiment being worn and filmed performing the same movements as possible under each condition. Since it is not possible to perfectly reproduce the performer's movements, these comparison videos should be viewed only as a reference.

### A: Move the head from side to side.
